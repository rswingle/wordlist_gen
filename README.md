This is a simple python script to generate a wordlist of all possible character
combinations in a given range.

The default settings for this tool generates all possible combinations from 6-24 
characters

Once the wordlist is done generating, run hashes.py to generate MD5, SHA1, SHA256, 
and SHA512 hashes of the wordlist. This will generate a file called "hashes.txt"
that can be used along with the wordlist depending on needs
